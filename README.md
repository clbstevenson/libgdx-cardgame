# Ludum Dare 37 - "One Room"
### LD Jam

This repository is for the Ludum Dare 37 Jam competition. It uses [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki), [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley), and some [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D).
 
### Sample Code

The starting code for this was based off of the
[libgdx-ashley-box2d-example](https://www.github.com/RoaringCatGames/libgdx-ashley-box2d-example)
created by [RoaringCatGames.](http://roaringcatgames.com/)
I used the code provided as a base for understanding Entity Component Systems and using ECS with Box2D and libGDX.
The starting code can be found in the package [com.exovum.testgame](core/src/com/exovum/testgame)

Also, see [README-sample.md](README-sample.md) as the original README.

You can also find the warmup code I tested some functionality with in the [ld37-warmup](https://github.com/exovum/ld37-warmup) repository.
